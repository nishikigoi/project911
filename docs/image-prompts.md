# Project 911  Image Prompts (Noir Illustration, 16:9)

Purpose: A prompt pack to generate one illustration per scene with a consistent noir tone.

- Aspect ratio: 16:9 (recommended: 1280720 / 19201080)
- Global rules: no text/logos/watermarks, no UI elements, avoid excessive gore (dark is fine; avoid explicit brutality)

---

## Common Style (copy/paste)

**Style block**
- Noir illustration style, cinematic lighting, strong contrast (high contrast, chiaroscuro)
- Muted colors, cool tone (blue-gray), subtle film grain
- Natural perspective (50mm equivalent), cinematic composition, a hint of city presence in the background

**Negative (generic)**
- text, captions, subtitles, logo, watermark, signature, UI
- low quality, blurry, broken anatomy, extra fingers, deformed face
- overly bright primary colors, too anime, comedic, excessive gore, explicit blood

---

## Character Anchors (for consistency)

- David: late 30s, short hair, stubble, tired eyes. Workwear to a modest jacket. Calm, muted colors.
- Mary: 30s, practical, clean look. Not flashy. Strong presence even in shadow.
- Lily: elementary school age; fits with drawing paper and craft tools.
- Tommy: young child; small everyday props like shoelaces or a TV remote.

**public/assets/bad_scene10.webp** (phone room / rows of receivers)
- Prompt: Narrow room lined wall-to-wall with old telephones. Their cords are cut, yet the atmosphere feels charged. Newspaper clippings on the floor as indistinct paper fragments (no readable text). Behind: wiring glows red slightly, but no flames. 16:9.

### Clear

**public/assets/clear.webp** (silence in the dark / the night is saved)
- Prompt: The quiet immediately after the house power is cut. Boundary between kitchen and living room in darkness; only streetlight through the window slices across the floor. The father shows a brief relief; the presence of sleeping family is felt off-screen. Small but certain hope. 16:9.
